I graduated from University of Toronto in 2018, with Hornors Bachelor of Science Diploma, in Applied Mathematics, Statistics and Economics. I worked in the Data Analytics field for more than 3 years after my graduation, and during the same period, I also advanced my programming skills (SQL, Python, R etc.) via multiple courses/continuing studies/research opportunities. After which, I decided to take some advanced education to improve my modeling skills, so I started my Master of Engineering studies in 2021, and am currently studying Operations Research and Information Engineering at Cornell University, with my concentration in Data Analytics.
